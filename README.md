# Discrete Event Traffic Simulation

This project outlines the development of a Traffic Simulation model designed to replicate
the behavior of a call-handling system through discrete events.

It is divided into 3 Parts:
1. Develop and compare two simulation programs to model a Poisson arrival process and validate empirical results against theoretical expectations.

2. Implement and analyze discrete event-driven simulations of packet-based loss and waiting systems using Erlang-B, Erlang-C, and finite-queue models, comparing performance metrics with theoretical predictions.

3. Simulate a call center system with general-purpose and area-specific operators, modeling queue dynamics, delay, and prediction errors to evaluate and optimize system performance against predefined service-level targets.

Each part of the project is developed in its own dedicated Git branch.
